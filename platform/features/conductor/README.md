Provides the time conductor, a control which appears at the
bottom of the screen allowing telemetry start and end times
to be modified.

Note that the term "time controller" is generally preferred
outside of the code base (e.g. in UI documents, issues, etc.);
the term "time conductor" is being used in code to avoid
confusion with "controllers" in the Model-View-Controller
sense.
